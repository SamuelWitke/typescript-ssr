Due to the benefits of SSR, when we transformed our stack to React and Nodejs, we put a lot of time and effort in optimizing SSR performance. One of our key metrics for measuring performance is “above the fold” render. Our Electrode framework that we open sourced has multiple modules to improve the performance of SSR and I blogged previously about the benefit of those modules.
